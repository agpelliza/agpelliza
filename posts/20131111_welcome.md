For a while I've been asked about Ruby and it's ecosystem and some other recurrent subjects. However I'm pleased to assist and contribute with others, I think that it can be really helpful to have a space to write about this things. So I came up with this tiny spot in the web for those people.. and for my self. 

I'm trying to create a reminder for those things I'm searching the web over and over again, and I hope it can help as a *knowledge-transfer-tool* for other developers or, why not, non developers interested in what I'm constantly learning and researching about..

Thats all what this is about.
