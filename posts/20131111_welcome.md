For a while I've been asked, repeatedly, about Ruby and it's ecosystem, so I decide to create this tiny space in the web for those people.. and for my self. 

I'm trying to create a reminder for those things I'm searching over and over at the web, and I hope it can help as a knowledge transfer tool for other developers or, why not, non developers interested in what I'm constantly learning and researching about..

Thats all what this is about.
